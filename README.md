## My process

### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styles
- [React Icons](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons) - For icons
- [Axios](https://axios-http.com/) - For posting API

### What I learned

In this challenge, I learned how to develop a landing page: from understanding the design into practice with coding, svg,... Once again, I used React and Tailwind to create the web app and quite satisfied with the results. One thing I noticed is that when making the UI, flex is everywhere, especially when making responsive. If these are in one line, of the same direction then it must be flex. Also I quite surprise that over one million people using the react-copy-to-clipboard dependency every week! This tool is very helpful yet also simple.

### Continued development

Even though I managed to complete the challenge, it still takes me hours to complete. In the future I must improve the performance to develop faster and more effective.

### Useful resources

- [Chat GPT](https://chat.openai.com/chat) - At this point I must say that this AI tool is a game changer, it is even better than Google and Stack Overflow at most cases.
- [React Copy To Clipboard](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-copy-to-clipboard) - As mentioned above, this dependency helped me with handling copy-to-clipboard, by just writing some lines of code.
